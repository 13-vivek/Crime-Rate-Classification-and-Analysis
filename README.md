This project emphasizes creating a system for classifying crimes through machine learning models such as Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression to identify crimes as violent or non-violent from India's crime records. The task is to preprocess and analyze crime datasets, apply and compare various models, and create an interactive Streamlit-based web application for making real-time predictions. 
The major findings are that Random Forest performs better than other models, and accurate feature preprocessing greatly improves accuracy.
The solution involves a web-based application allowing users to input data, view results in visualization, and classify crimes effectively. The project shows the capability of machine learning for crime analysis with a data-driven solution to support law enforcement agencies in crime prevention and decision-making.
